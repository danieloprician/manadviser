# Elicitation Methods (Company)

Field-proven techniques to discover and refine requirements. Pick the lightest method that answers the question; combine as needed.

## 1) Stakeholder interviews
- Use when: Clarifying goals, constraints, success metrics, or hidden requirements.
- Preparation: Interview guide with top 8–12 questions; consent to record; target roles.
- Steps:
	1. Open with outcomes and timebox; ask open questions; dig into “why” and “how often”.
	2. Capture quotes and facts; flag assumptions; ask for examples/artifacts.
	3. Close with summary, gaps, and follow-ups.
- Outputs: Interview notes, risks/assumptions list, decisions and open questions.

## 2) Contextual inquiry (on-the-job observation)
- Use when: Understanding real workflows, tools, and blockers.
- Steps: Observe tasks, ask “think aloud”, capture artifacts/screens, time pain points.
- Outputs: As-is workflow, pain points, opportunities, and time-to-task metrics.

## 3) Journey mapping
- Use when: Visualizing end-to-end user experience across touchpoints.
- Steps: Define persona, stages, actions, feelings, pain points, opportunities.
- Outputs: Journey map with prioritized opportunities and hypotheses.

## 4) Prototyping feedback
- Use when: Testing concepts cheaply before committing.
- Steps: Prepare clickable or paper prototype; define tasks; observe success/struggle.
- Outputs: Findings matrix (what worked/struggled), design decisions, next prototype.

## 5) Requirements workshops
- Use when: Aligning on scope, AC, and definitions across multiple stakeholders.
- Steps: Timebox; start with goals; draft user stories; define AC using GWT; dot-vote.
- Outputs: Prioritized stories, AC, open questions, and decision log.

## Artifacts to produce
- Decision log entries
- Risks and assumptions
- User stories with AC (GWT)
- Updated PRD sections
